# Raspberry Pi-crowave

I added an Arduino and Raspberry Pi to my microwave.

Now it has:

* Re-designed UI
* Clock is automatically set via NTP
* Voice control
* Barcode-scanner to look up food preparation times and automatically cook food
* Twitter


This project is currently in progress... I need this repo so I can clone it onto my Raspberry Pi.
